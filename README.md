This is a responsive and multilingual weather application developed using React JS, designed to provide users with a clear and user-friendly display of current weather conditions. Leveraging the power of Axios, the app fetches real-time weather data from an external API, ensuring users always have access to the most up-to-date information.

The interface is styled with Material UI, delivering a modern, clean, and accessible design across devices. Moment.js is used to format and localize dates and times, while i18n integration ensures that users can view the interface in multiple languages â€” as shown in the provided screenshot, where Arabic is used.

Localized date and day 

Icon representation of weather (e.g., clear skies, cloudy)

Responsive card-based layout with a shadow effect

Language switch (Arabic/English) supported by i18n

Perfect for users who want a straightforward and beautiful weather app in their preferred language.
